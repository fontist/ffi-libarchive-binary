== Purpose

Contains pre-compiled and install-time-compiled binaries for ffi-libarchive.


== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "ffi-libarchive-binary"
----

And then execute:

[source,sh]
----
$ bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source,sh]
----
$ gem install ffi-libarchive-binary
----


== Usage

Require the gem and use calls from https://github.com/chef/ffi-libarchive[ffi-libarchive].

[source,ruby]
----
require "ffi-libarchive-binary"

path = File.expand_path('file.pkg', __dir__)
flags = Archive::EXTRACT_PERM
reader = Archive::Reader.open_filename(path)

reader.each_entry do |entry|
  reader.extract(entry, flags.to_i)
end

reader.close

NOTE: The gem provides pre-compiled binaries for 10 platforms. Separate binaries
are provided for glibc-based (gnu) and musl-based Linux distributions to ensure
compatibility. Windows ARM64 support is planned for future releases pending
resolution of OpenSSL build system compatibility issues with MSYS2 CLANGARM64.

=== OpenSSL compiler target strategy

The gem explicitly sets OpenSSL compiler targets to ensure correct assembly
code generation:

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Platform | Compiler Target | Reason

| Windows x64 | `mingw64` | Explicit x86_64 assembly selection
| Linux x86_64 (gnu/musl) | Auto-detect | Native toolchain works correctly
| Linux ARM64 (gnu/musl) | Auto-detect | Native toolchain works correctly
| macOS ARM64 | Auto-detect | Native toolchain works correctly
| macOS x64 | Auto-detect | Native toolchain works correctly
|===

NOTE: Windows platforms require explicit compiler targets because OpenSSL's
auto-detection does not reliably select the correct target on Windows.
Linux musl and glibc variants use the same OpenSSL configuration with
auto-detection, as the toolchain correctly identifies the target.

== Build requirements

=== Windows

==== Windows x64

For building from source on Windows x64, you need:

* Ruby 2.7 or higher with DevKit
* MinGW-w64 x86_64 toolchain
* MSYS2 (recommended) or equivalent Unix-like environment

=== macOS
